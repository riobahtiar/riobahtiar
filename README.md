### ✨  Hi, I'm Rio! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer who loves books 📚, swimming 🏊, and sci-fi movies 🎬.

As a versatile 🔭 Full Stack Developer, I've built a strong foundation in both backend and frontend technologies. On the backend, I'm proficient with PHP(Laravel & WordPress), Golang, and databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis. On the frontend, I specialize in ReactJS, NextJS, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js, crafting engaging user interfaces. In addition, I have experience with cloud architecture, including AWS and Google Cloud.

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at Sekolah.mu, primarily focusing on frontend development with Vue.js and Nuxt.js.
